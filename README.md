CodeTools
=========

An easy to use JUCE application that contains various tools to help clean your code.

Modulariser

If you're a fan of the Unity Build, and really enjoy fast compile times in your projects, this tool automates the grunt work: amalgamating your inclusions of headers into a large list located in a new C++ header file, and the implementations into a large list located in a CPP file.

It requires having include guards in your header files (stop using the useless #pragma once already!) to avoid repetitive inclusions!

Trailing Whitespace Cleaner

Ever get tired of keying through your awesome code only to find your cursor passing through trailing whitespace? You can get rid of that with this simple tool.

Line-Endings Converter

This is handy if you're transferring code from one operating system to another. The tool will search through all your lines and convert their endings to whatever you have specified.

Tabs to Spaces

Convert those sneaky tabs to a desired number of spaces.
